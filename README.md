# Pneumonia-Detection

This project uses the dataset found here https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia. It is a dataset of 5,863 X-Ray images seperated into two categories - Pneumonia and Normal. I used a VGG16 model with imagenet weights to detect whether the X-Rays contained pneumonia or not. The results could be improved apon by augmenting the pictures to make a more complete dataset, especially since the number of pictures was skewed towards X-Rays of pneumonia.
